...but memorable because it includes an actor I actually recognize! █████ █████ is, by these types of movies' standards, ████████ ███████. He's given some decent performances on stuff like Highlander and various Star Treks, so it's kind of amusing, if mildly depressing, watching him degrade himself here. Okay, yeah, there's a plot. █████'s character and his wife are fighting, he's having an affair with a movie reviewer while trying to do his "masterpiece" film, and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping. But watching █████ is really the only enjoyment to be found here.
